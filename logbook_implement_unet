GOAL: run unet with my data

1. check if all packages are installed in forestforest env - CHECK
2. check which arguments to pass
   + arch shouldn't matter because not called in prepare_resnet
   - checkpoint_path: called in load_dino_checkpoint but which checkpoint correct and even needed?
   - checkpoint_key: see checkpoint_path! teacher? or even needed?
   + data_path: my data path
   - crop_size: keep default?
   + num_chans: default 4, so fine
   + num_classes: must be 4
   - lr: keep default? Research good learning rate.
   + batch_size: keep 32. only change for improvement
   + num_workers: keep default 8
   + output_dir: choose new one for unet, e.g. test_unet
   + max_epochs: keep small for debugging, then high to see when model learns and overfitts
   - freeze_backbone: probably must be passed just like in light_segmentation.py?
3. run run_unet_p.sh file
   - error: segmentation_models_pytorch not installed
     - installation using pip install -U segmentation-models-pytorch not working due to package dependency issues:
       ERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed. This behaviour is the source of the following dependency conflicts.
       lightning 2.4.0 requires torch<4.0,>=2.1.0, but you have torch 1.13.1 which is incompatible.
       pytorch-lightning 2.3.0 requires torch>=2.0.0, but you have torch 1.13.1 which is incompatible.
     - creating new environment called unetunet and installing packages manually:
       1. conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia
       2.
